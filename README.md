Setup Steps:** Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the code in the "Object Detection.ipynb" file.

1.Open Anaconda Prompt.

2.Navigate to a relevant path where you want to set up the environment.

3.Execute the following commands line by line

3.1 "python -m venv IM8 " # (IM8 is the kernel name; you can use any name you prefer)

3.2 ".\IM8\Scripts\activate"

3.3 "pip install ipykernel"

3.4 "python -m ipykernel install --name=IM8"

These commands will create and activate a virtual environment named "IM8" and install the necessary kernel for running the code.

Your kernel has been successfully created.

Add Object Detection image and video to the relevant kernel path.

Using Jupyter Notebook, create a new file.

Select the kernel you created ("IM8").
